        <div class="text-content">
          <p class="text-large">
            From the very start, my life was shaped by grief. After losing my father at a few months old, my natural role was being the light, the joy and the life in the home. I recognized early on that while I could be that person for everyone around me, my deepest desire was to receive a version of what I was giving to the world. Slowly, childhood trauma effectively disconnected me from myself, from my light, my truth, and my worth. I needed my own medicine- but I was the only one who couldn't access it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-large">
            Still, it was undetectable. I was the child who won the happiness award at camp every summer, I was magnetic and had close friends wherever I went. I was everyone and anyone's destination for a listening ear. I was the friend you considered your best friend. I offered support, friendship, coaching and guidance to many people who walked through my life.
          </p>
          <p class="text-large">
            As I became a young wife, and then a mother, I continued chasing wholeness. Seeking safety in relationships, religion, and achievement, my grief followed me through every season: marriage, motherhood, divorce. Through those years I was achieving external success under the invisible shadow of survival.
          </p>
          <p class="text-large">
            I did the only thing that I knew how to do: keep going. Power through. Be strong. Until one day, my body said no. I found myself terribly ill, alone in a hospital, fighting for my life. And I knew something had to change. In that moment, I made a promise: If I survive this, I will no longer abandon myself. I will live differently.
          </p>
          <p class="text-large">
            That was the beginning.
          </p>
          <p class="text-large">
            My healing journey truly began when I stopped trying to be who I thought I had to be, and started the deep work of reparenting myself. Of healing the mother wound. Of becoming the nurturing presence I never had, both for myself and for my children.
          </p>
          <p class="text-large">
            With the support of my own teachers and guides, I began to remember who I truly was, to really come alive for the first time in over 30 years. Through deep inner work, spiritual connection, and radical self-responsibility, I began to feel again. To grieve. To trust. To reclaim my voice. I found safety inside myself. And in that process, I discovered a grounded, radiant power I never knew I had.
          </p>
          <p class="text-large">
            That journeyâ€”of returning to myself, of finding my light through the mirror of others, lit a fire in me. Because I know I'm not the only one.
          </p>
          <p class="text-large">
            If you're longing for more, it's because the 'more' already lives within you. That ache you feel isn't something broken. It's something sacred, waiting to be remembered.
          </p>
          <p class="text-large">
            Today, I hold space for other women as they move through their own initiations. Whether you're navigating a breaking point or a breakthrough, I'm here to walk with you. To witness you. To reflect your truth back to you. To help you come home to yourself.
          </p>

            I've found my light.
